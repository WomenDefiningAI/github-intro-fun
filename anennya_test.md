## A Poem About GitHub

In digital realms where code takes flight,
GitHub stands as a beacon bright.
Where developers gather from near and far,
To build together, raise the bar.

Each commit tells a story true,
Of changes made, both old and new.
Branches diverge, then merge as one,
Like rivers flowing 'neath the sun.

Pull requests open doors to review,
Where collaboration comes in view.
Issues track the bugs we find,
And milestones mark the path designed.

The green squares on your profile page,
Show dedication, day by day.
Contributions small and grand,
All part of a greater plan.

From solo projects to teams so vast,
GitHub makes the future last.
Version control, a safety net,
For code we write, we won't forget.

So here's to GitHub, platform grand,
Where open source can take a stand.
A place where code and community meet,
Making the developer's journey sweet.
